## Organising

- We open up for reflections, questions in the audience
- Remember to share your context - to help us understand
- There are NO stupid questions (beside the ones not asked :) )!
- Remember: There is no end state for application security,</br> we just learn and improve
- We present a few question that can be used to guide the discussion

---

## Optional Questions

- Are the challenges familiar?
- Should we shift more effort into system testing?
- How can we avoid turning off A&A (or any security feature) when doing system testing?
- What impact does this have on patterns and architecture - testability?
- Could we involve the customer in writing, running and maintaining system tests (acceptance tests)?
