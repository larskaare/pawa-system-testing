## Organizing groups

- We split into small groups
- We time box conversations to 30 minutes
- The one which went to the movies last becomes group lead
- Group lead facilitates, takes notes, share these on behalf of the group
- Each group picks topics from the workshop, or guiding questions to facilitate the discussion.
  
</br><div style="background-color:grey">There is no right or wrong path of the discussions. Any path the group takes is the right one</div>

## Optional Questions

- Are the challenges familiar?
- Should we shift more effort into system testing?
- How can we avoid turning off A&A (or any security feature) when doing system testing?
- What impact does this have on patterns and architecture - testability?
- Could we involve the customer in writing, running and maintaining system tests (acceptance tests)?

Remember to briefly share your context with your group. It will help others understand your questions and reflections.
