# Some observations

## Team reports that

<div style="font-size:0.8em">

- 80%+ of test effort is spent on unit testing, very little on system testing.
- Authn/z are either mocked/stubbed or disabled when testing<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- We don't write security related tests<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- In testing, security features are often disabled/mocked<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- In "modern systems", especially when we are hurrying into the cloud and shifting security left, we really should do more system testing, but it's hard!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- The challenges have multiple perspectives; technical, personal skills/proficiency, team compositions, team capacity and not the least team/company culture!<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

My context is primarily experience taken from working in the Nordics/Europe.<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->
