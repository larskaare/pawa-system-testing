# Some observations

## Team reports that

<div style="font-size:0.8em">

- 80%+ of test effort is spent on unit testing, very little on system testing.
- Authn/z are either mocked/stubbed or disabled when testing
- We don't write security related tests, </br>security features are often disabled/mocked.
- In modern systems, especially when we are hurrying into the cloud and shifting security left, we **really** should do more system testing, but it's hard!
- The challenges have multiple perspectives; technical, personal skills/proficiency, team compositions, team capacity and not the least team/company **culture**!

My context is primarily experience taken from working in the Nordics/Europe.
