## Current status

<div style="font-size:0.9em">

For our "complex and modern system" we now have:

- A fully automation system test scenario<!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- A fully synthetic test environment <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" -->
  System tests with active Authn/z <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- System tests with active security controls <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- We have very little test support code <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="5" -->

We have broken a few principles to reach this state - </br>the trade-offs could be acceptable? <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

Again, a threat modeling exercise on the test system would be smart.</br>What could possibly go wrong ðŸ™‚ <!-- .element: class="fragment" data-fragment-index="6" -->

## Our Objective

> Encourage teams to divert more effort on to system testing with authn/z (and other security features) activated.

It is hard, not only a technical challenge </br>- but it is doable - and necessary ...
